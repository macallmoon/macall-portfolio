          <h4>“Every great design begins with an even better story.”</h4>
          <h5 class="right-align">- Lorinda Mamo, Designer</h5>
          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <h5>
            I learned the power of a good story when I worked as an interior designer. Presenting a design can feel like explaining something to a person who speaks another language. But when you frame your design vision within a compelling story, things start to resonate. The story helps us understand the 'why'. In a similar way, I could simply tell you that I am passionate about UX design, but that would likely feel hollow without the full story.<br><br>
            I’ve always been creative. As a kid, my favorite pastime was designing my ‘dream house’. I preferred designing over drawing pictures because it gave me a problem to solve. Like many creatives, I was very introspective. Observing was my comfort zone. In high school, I took a class on psychology and my eyes were opened to a deeper level of the human experience. The human psyche fascinated me and I was hooked. I graduated college with a degree in health sciences, planning to continue onto grad school. Instead, my husband and I took an opportunity to travel full-time, living out of our car.
          </h5>
          <h4>After 1 year, 50 states, and 60,000 miles, I had pushed myself to do a lot of hard things. I had climbed out of my comfort zone and all the way to the top of a few 14,000 foot peaks.</h4>
          <h5>
            I had dreamed of being a designer and finally had the nerve to pursue it. I got an internship doing interior design in Salt Lake City. It was a painfully steep learning curve. I knew nothing about the business, the design process, or even the software they used. But within a couple of months, I was up to speed and loved tackling so many new challenges. But in the back of my mind, there was something missing. I wanted to do more to help people.<br><br>
            I began a UX design mentorship in September of 2019. UX design is a blast and satisfies all of my passions - creativity, psychology, problem solving, and helping people. I feel a bit like Sherlock Holmes, piecing together information and solving puzzles. Now I just need an iconic hat.
