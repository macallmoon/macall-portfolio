      <h4>“Every great design begins with an even better story.”</h4>
      <h5>-  Lorinda Mamo, Designer</h5>
      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <h5>
        I learned the power of guiding design with a story when I worked as an interior designer. A beautiful design is hollow without a purpose. People need a solid ‘why’ before they will buy in. I can raise my right hand and swear to everything holy that I love design and feel like it’s my perfect match. That my interests and aptitudes align with the skills needed to be a great designer. But that sentiment is hollow without the full story.<br><br>
        I’ve always been creative. As a kid, my favorite pastime was designing my ‘dream house’. I preferred designing over drawing pictures because it gave me a problem to solve. Like many creatives, I was very introspective, always the observer. In high school, I took AP Psychology and my eyes were opened to a deeper level of the human experience. I was hooked. I graduated college with a degree in health sciences, planning to continue on to medical school. Instead, my husband and I decided to travel full-time, living out of our car.
      </h5>
      <h4>After 1 year, 50 states, and 60,000 miles, I had pushed myself, done hard things, and learned to trust myself.</h4>
      <h5>
        I got an internship in interior design in Salt Lake City. It was a painfully steep learning curve. I knew nothing about the business, the design process, or even the software they used. But within a couple of months, I was up to speed and loving working in design. I was flexing so many mental muscles - designing layouts, selecting finishes, combing through construction documents, and working with a great team. But in the back of my mind, there was still something missing. I wanted to do more to help people.<br><br>
        I started the UX design mentorship at Bloc in September of 2019. During my time in the program, I fell more in love with design than ever before. Practicing UX design satisfies all of my passions - creativity, psychology, problem solving, and helping people. I fancy myself something of a sleuth, searching for clues and solving puzzles. I am thrilled that I found my way to UX design and I’m excited to solve the next puzzle.
