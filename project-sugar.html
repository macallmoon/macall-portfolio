        <h5>Most of our homes are full of things we rarely use. We spend money on these things, then have to store them, and eventually they all end up in landfill. Why would you spend hundreds of dollars on a camera that you will use once a year when your nextdoor neighbor has one sitting in their desk drawer? Or a ladder? A suitcase? A projector?...</h5>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <h5>The solution is a platform where you can borrow what you need from people in your area. 93% of people said they would be open to lending their things and 83% said they would be open to borrowing. So I designed a website to facilitate that interaction.</h5>

        <h4>User Stories</h4>
        <h5>From the survey and personas, I wrote the user stories and prioritized them.
            The stories include basic app functions like create account, add listing, etc. But the stories that directly address the main user needs are:<br><br>
            Peace of mind: As a user, I want a signed contract so I know what to do if something goes wrong.<br><br>
            Control over who they interact with: As a lender, I want to accept or decline a request to borrow an item.<br><br>
            Guidance for how much to charge: As a lender, I want to know how much to charge for an item.<br><br>
            Control over how much to charge: As a lender, I want to set the price for my item.<br><br>
            Although the survey suggested that users might be interested in having social features in the site so they can share with people they know, I chose not to include that in the initial MVP. I wanted to create the leanest site that would get the job done well, but not perfectly. The leanest way to solve this was to give the control to the user, so lenders can choose to accept or deny any request for any reason.

          Once I had decided the general layouts for my screens, I created digital wireframes in Figma. I wanted to keep these wireframes very stripped down and gray-scale with only the basic layout and functionality so that I could test the basic functionality of my solution.

          With my wireframes, I created an InVision prototype for my first round of usability testing.<br><br>
          I had my users guess the purpose of my site based only on the home screen and then I asked them to complete 4 tasks:
        </h5>
        <p>
          Create an account<br>
          Add a listing<br>

        <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
        <h5>
          The purpose of the site was very unclear. I  was missing a hero image in my wireframes, so I thought creating an illustration for the home page would help.<br><br>
          I had two separate menus in my initial design and found that it was very confusing for some users. I decided to just combine everything into one menu.<br><br>
          The “Create Listing” button was  too difficult for users to find. I thought I would add a direct link into the navigation menu to make it more accessible.<br><br>
          Users were confused about which page they were on. My initial thought was that adding color and style to the screens would help visually differentiate the screens.<br><br>
          Users didn’t understand some of the terms I was using, specifically around pricing. I thought adding some definitions and tips would help clarify the process.

        <h4>Brand Characteristics</h4>
        <h5>
          The  id “Sugar” comes from the concept of borrowing a cup of sugar from a neighbor, so I wanted to embody that neighborly vibe in the branding. However, because I knew that users were concerned about damage and theft, I needed to make sure the site came across as professional and trustworthy. The brand characteristics I wanted to embody are:
        </h5>
        <p>
          Professional<br>
          Fun<br>
          Friendly<br>

        <h5>
          For the color palette, my initial thought was to use greens because the environment was such a large motivator for users. However, I ultimately felt that didn’t jive well with the  id “Sugar”, and decided I could do better. Pinks and purples are an obvious choice because they are bubbly and sweet, but I wanted to keep it gender neutral and that could easily turn feminine. I decided on a terracotta orange and periwinkle blue. They are gender neutral, friendly, professional, earthy, and align well with the  id “Sugar”.

        </div>
        <h5>
          I struggled with the typography because I found it difficult to balance the fun/friendly side with the professional/trustworthy side. I knew I wanted to use two typefaces, one for the headers and one for body text. <br><br>
          For the headers, I liked the personality of some of the more organic typefaces, but ultimately decided they felt unprofessional. As for body text, I knew I wanted something with a serif and a fairly uniform stroke so that it would be easy to read. I decided to use Raleway for the headers and Zilla Slab for the body. <br><br>
          The logo text is actually a modification of Raleway Dots, but rather than dots, I used small squares, reminiscent of sugar cubes.

        <h4>High Fidelity Mockups - v2</h4>
        <h5>
          Taking all of that feedback into account, I made another round of iterations to my designs. The changes in this round were:<br><br>
          Scaling back the background colors.<br><br>
          Reducing the amount of dialog boxes.<br><br>
          Changing the “new message” highlight to a different type of marker.

        <h4>Usability Testing - Round 2</h4>
        <h5>
          At this point, I had added quite a bit to my designs and I needed to validate my decisions. I did a second round of usability tests and this time built my prototype in Figma so that I could take advantage of the horizontal scrolling feature. For this test, I again asked the users to guess the purpose of the website and then to complete six tasks:
        </h5>
        <p>
          Create an account<br>
          Add a listing<br>
          Request to borrow an item<br>
          Accept a borrow request<br>
          Delete a listing<br>
          Respond to a new message<br>
        </p>

      <!--Key Takeaways-->
      <section class="minor-section">
        <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
        <h5>
          The purpose of the site was much more clear with the addition of the illustration.<br><br>
          Navigation within the site needed to be quicker. Users were getting frustrated that they had to go into the menu to get anywhere, so I thought adding a bottom navigation bar would make the site more accessible.<br><br>
          During one of my iterations, I had accidentally removed the “Create Listing” button from my navigation menu, so it was once again too difficult to find. I thought the bottom navigation bar would be a great place to include it.<br><br>
          Users were still having a difficult time with page differentiation, even after adding color and style. I decided to do three things:
        </h5>
        <p>
          Add page titles.<br><br>
          Change the color of the search bar on some pages and add prompting text.<br><br>
          Change the layout of the listing cards within the browse section of the site.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h4>Final Design</h4>
        <h5>
          In my final design, I made the following changes:<br><br>
          Added bottom navigation with a “Create Listing” button.<br><br>
          Added page titles.<br><br>
          Changed search bar color and added prompting text.<br><br>
          Changed the layout of the listing cards within browse so they no longer resemble the listings on the “My Listings” page.

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <h5>
          The problems I set out to solve were wasted money, storage, and landfill.  There is ample opportunity in the marketplace for a product that solves users’ needs, which are:
        </h5>
        <p>
          Peace of mind<br>
          Control over who they interact with<br>
          Guidance for pricing<br>
          Control over pricing
        </p>
        <h5>
          Sugar delivers on all of these user needs with a platform that is friendly, trustworthy, and intuitive and gives consumers the option to share things within their neighborhood.
